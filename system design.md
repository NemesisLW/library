# Concepts
***
**~(*software engineering*)**
* **ACID**: Atomicity. Consistency. Isolated. Durable.
* CAP Theorem *

**~(*networking*)**
* **protocol**:
* **IP address**:
* TCP/IP:
* DNS:
* HTTP:

**~(*scaling*)**
* **vertical scaling**: add more compute (RAM & CPU) to the single device. Easy but limited upside ceiling. 
* **horizontal scaling**: add more devices/replicas to the ecosystem/server. infinite scaling. adds redundancy & fault tolerance. 
* **load balancer**: the process of distributing tasks across resources to make processing more efficient. Improves response time and prevent compute nodes from being overloaded. can be hardware or software-based. *Higher throughput than (?).* performant and monitoring capabilities(health check).
	```a device that sits between the user and the server group to act as an invisible facilitator to ensure resource servers are equally used```.
	* ***algorithms used to determine which server should handle requests*** - round robin(simplest), hashing(source IP hash, consistent hashing), least connection (sends the connection to the server that is performing best based on the number of connections it is managing).

**~(*web infrastructures & API patterns*)**
* **https requests & response**::
* **web-hooks**: 
* **web-sockets**:
* *
**~(*database management*)**
* ***SQL vs. NoSQL Trade-offs***:
**~(*distributed systems*)**
**~(*frontend performance*)**
